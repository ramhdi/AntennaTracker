/*This library uses interrupts to read PWM values. It is only intended to be used with Arduino Uno or Mega boards.
   It is capable of reading high pulse (normal pwm) or low pulse (inverted pwm).

   Usage:
   1. Copy PWM.cpp and PWM.hpp in your project folder.
   1. Include PWM.hpp in your program. example #include "PWM.hpp"
   2. Create a PWM instance variable and call it what you want. example: PWM my_pwm;
   3. Initialise PWM instance you made and provide pin and trigger condition. example my_pwm.begin(2, 1);
   4. Call getValue to get PWM value. example *some_variable* = my_pwm.getValue();
*/

#include <Arduino.h>
// PWM class
class PWM {
    byte my_pin;
  public:
    void begin(byte pin, byte state);
    // pin = the digital pin to attach interrupt
    // On Arduino Uno, Nano, Mini, other 328-based, only pins 2 & 3 are usable for interrupts
    // On Arduino Mega, Mega2560, MegaADK, only pins 2, 3, 18, 19, 20 & 21 are usable for interrupts
    // State = 1 => the library will measure the duration of HIGH pulse (normal pwm)
    // State = 0 => the library will measure the duration of LOW pulse (inverted pwm)
    unsigned int getValue();
    // returns the pwm value
